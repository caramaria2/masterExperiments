Now they are removed only when the screen has to refresh (such as adding a new task, reopening the app, rotating the screen etc).

(** Side note, skip to closing parentheses for rest of review ** I'm putting it out there officially here, we need to practice some common sense etiquette for webinar chat. My vote: Same rule as texting. I always say I don't text (try not to) anything I wouldn't say to your face. Don't type anything into a chat box in a webinar attended by 20 or more ppl that you wouldn't raise your hand and say at a live presentation or event. I include myself here, I think it's very tempting to type and get attention, forgetting there are 59 other invisible but real people who politely don't want to hear/read every thought that crosses your mind. Add to that the ability to chat with other attendees, and it's way too noisy and distracting. Just picture a live event, and use restraint, which most folks do, but I'm asking people to be aware and intentional about this. And presenters should lead the way and be clear how they want the chat feature used as well. Keeping in mind, I am there to learn, and so far my brain hasn't evolved to where I can learn effectively and process info that way, with both input and output fully active. Maybe just me, or maybe I'm wrong. Just my two cents, end of side note.) Anyway, this app missed the mark in the only area that mattered which was audio. Again not sure what issue was but audio cut in and out several different times, had to fiddle around trying to figure a fix and turned out (and here chat WAS handy) i could fix by logging in and out.

I miss an option to make an album (or chosse batch), and then scan into the album, autoname files by the album and then upload the full album online (instead of having to choose indiviual files manually from the main list). The overview with all scans being thrown into one main list isn't functionally satisfying. Also too much back and forth to rename scans that belong to a named group - you have to remember to reset to a new default name each time, manually mark files and then upload. This is all handier with Camscanner (batch mode which saves all scans into a indivitual sets and let's you ""select all"" ) or Photomyne (albums). It would be nice to have a choice to do batch and then be asked what the default name of the files should be. But maybe this is already possible Scanbot and I missed it? Otherwise 10 stars! - November 3 update: I jist found out that group naming is a snap! Just choose multipage scanning. You will see the default naming scheme on the top of the screen.
